Hello. Because there has not been many updates lately, here is a list of all the features coming soon
    -Nested objects like  {"Example": {"Foo": 12, "Bar": true}}
    -Syntax checker on JSON strings or files
    -JSON string or file decoder 
    -Finish the project by fixing bugs and ensuring memory management is safe

At the time I have made all these updates and improvements
this project will probably be in v1.0.0

I might be adding new and better improvements but still rarely, since
after v1.0.0 I will work on a new project
